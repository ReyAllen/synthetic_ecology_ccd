# synthetic_ecology_srm

Statistical model built and tested using defined and undefined artificial contaminant consortia.

Response variable is total contaminant growth as determined by OD600.
Main factors are pH, kanamycin, and NaCl concentrations.
A central composite design was used to build the model, augmenting a full factorial (2^3) with replicates at centerpoints.

Original model built and tested using JMP, a proprietary software.
Switched to R in order to increase transparency and reproducibility for publication.
